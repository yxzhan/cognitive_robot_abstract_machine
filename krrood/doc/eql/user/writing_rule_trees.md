# Advanced Inference: Rule Trees

Beyond simple queries, EQL supports an inference engine for building **Rule Trees**. This allows you to symbolically construct new objects or add information to existing variables based on complex, conditional logic.

## Core Concepts

A Rule Tree is built using three main components:
1.  **`deduced_variable(Type)`**: A special variable for objects that will be deduced by the rule.
2.  **`inference(Type)(**kwargs)`**: A special variable constructor for objects that will be "materialized" by the rule.
2.  **`add(target, value)`**: A conclusion clause that assigns a value to a symbolic variable.
3.  **ConclusionSelectors**: Logical branches that control rule evaluation flow and choose which conclusions are applied.
Examples: `refinement()`,`alternative()`, and `next_rule()`.


## The `with query:` Context

To build a rule tree, you use the query object as a context manager. Any `add`, `refinement`, or `alternative` inside
this block becomes part of that query's rule structure. We further discuss what each of these components do below.

```python
query = an(entity(views).where(...))

with query:
    add(views, default_conclusion)
    with refinement(extra_condition):
        add(views, specialized_conclusion)
```

```{warning}
Rule trees are for **inference** (adding data). For simple filtering, stick to `.where()` and standard queries.
```

## Conclusion Selectors

### 0. Query
One usually starts with a query that selects a `deduced_variable()`, and optionally add some conditions in the `where()`
clause. So in the example bellow we want to deduce views of type `View`, and we have a `FixedConnection` that connects
a `Body` to a `Handle` as the initial condition.
```python
views = deduced_variable(View)
handle = variable(ExampleHandle, domain=None)
body = variable(ExampleBody, domain=None)
fixed = variable(ExampleFixedConnection, domain=None)
query = an(entity(views).where(fixed.parent == body, fixed.child == handle))
````

### 1. Default Conclusion
The default conclusion is the one that is applied if none of the other branches match. So in the example bellow, we
 want to deduce a `Drawer` by default for every solution of the query.
```python
with query:
    add(views, inference(ExampleDrawer)(handle=handle, body=body))
```

### 2. Refining the condition using `refinement()`
Narrows the context with an additional condition. It behaves like a logical **AND** but is used specifically to 
specialize a rule. So in the example bellow, we want to deduce a `Door` instead of a `Drawer` if in addition to the
default condition the body size is greater than 1 meter.

```python
with query:
    add(views, inference(ExampleDrawer)(handle=handle, body=body))
    with refinement(body.size > 1):
        # This only happens if the body is big
        add(views, inference(ExampleDoor)(handle=handle, body=body))
```

### 3. Defining alternative conclusions using `alternative()`
Provides a sibling branch that is only evaluated if the previous branches didn't match. It behaves like an **Else-If**.
So in the example bellow, if the body and the handle are not connected through a fixed connection, but
through a revolute connection, we want to deduce a `DoorWithRevoluteHandle`. The conclusion of the `alternative()`
branch is only applied if the previous branches didn't match. So in this case, the condition when the where clause doesn't
succeed for some combination of body and handle. There are multiple ways the condition of the `where` can be False, one 
if fixed connection parent is not equal to body or if the fixed connection child is not equal to handle.

```python
with query:
    add(views, inference(ExampleDrawer)(handle=handle, body=body))
    revolute = variable(ExampleRevoluteConnection, domain=None)
    with alternative(revolute.parent == body, revolute.child == handle):
        add(views, inference(ExampleDoorWithRevoluteHandle)(handle=handle, body=body))
```

```{hint}
Use `refinement` for specialization (exceptions) and `alternative` for mutually exclusive cases.
```

## Full Example: Categorizing Connections

This example demonstrates how to build a rule tree that categorizes connections into either `Fixed` or `Revolute` views.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from dataclasses import dataclass
from krrood.entity_query_language.factories import (
    variable, entity, an, Symbol, deduced_variable, refinement, alternative, add, inference
)

@dataclass
class ExampleConnection(Symbol):
    type_code: int
    name: str

@dataclass
class ExampleView(Symbol):
    connection: ExampleConnection

@dataclass
class ExampleFixedView(ExampleView): pass

@dataclass
class ExampleRevoluteView(ExampleView): pass

# Data
conns = [ExampleConnection(1, 'c1'), ExampleConnection(2, 'c2'), ExampleConnection(3, 'c3'), ExampleConnection(4, 'm4')]
c = variable(ExampleConnection, domain=conns)
view = deduced_variable(ExampleView)

# 1. Base query
query = entity(view).where(c.name.startswith('c'))

# 2. Rule Tree definition
with query:
    # Default case:
    add(view, inference(ExampleView)(connection=c))
    
    # If type_code is 1, it's a ExampleFixedView
    with refinement(c.type_code == 1):
        add(view, inference(ExampleFixedView)(connection=c))
    
    # Otherwise, if type_code is 2, it's a ExampleRevoluteView
    with alternative(c.type_code == 2):
        add(view, inference(ExampleRevoluteView)(connection=c))

# 3. Execution
results = query.tolist()
print(f"Inferred {len(results)} views from {len(conns)} connections.")
print("\n".join([str(v) for v in results]))
```
