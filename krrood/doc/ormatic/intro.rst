ORMatic Overview
========

ORMatic is a subpackage of KRROOD designed to integrate Python **dataclasses** with the **SQLAlchemy ORM**.
It operates by generating a SQLAlchemy declarative model layer, offering utilities for translating between
domain objects (dataclasses) and database representations (rows).

This approach promotes a separation between the domain model and the persistence mechanism, allowing developers
to concentrate on business logic while abstracting underlying database implementation and SQLAlchemy specifics.

System Overview
---------------

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between the domain layer, the persistence layer, and the database:

- **Domain Layer**: This is where business logic and data structures are defined using standard Python dataclasses (**Domain Definitions**). Instances of these dataclasses are referred to as **Domain Objects**.
- **Persistence Layer**: ORMatic automatically generates a corresponding set of **Data Access Objects (DAOs)** based on the domain definitions. These DAOs are SQLAlchemy declarative models that handle the mapping to the database.
- **Mapping & Conversion**:
  - ``generate_orm()``: Analyzes domain definitions to automatically create the DAO structure.
  - ``to_dao()``: Converts domain objects into their DAO counterparts for persistence.
  - ``from_dao()``: Reconstructs domain objects from retrieved DAO instances.
- **Database Interaction**: The persistence layer communicates with the **RDBMS** via SQLAlchemy sessions, providing a clean abstraction over the physical storage.

I recommend to structure your Python package to work cleanly with ORMatic as follows:

::

    domain_model/
    ├── scripts/
    │   └── generate_orm.py               # Script to configure ORMatic
    ├── src/
    │   └── domain_model/
    │       └── orm/
    │           ├── __init__.py           # Package initializer
    │           ├── model.py              # Custom types and alternative mappings
    │           └── ormatic_interface.py  # Generated target file for ORMatic
    └── tests/
        └── conftest.py                   # Pytest config; automatically runs generate_orm.py


You can make your conftest automatically refresh the ormatic_interface.py by including something like this in your
conftest.py:

.. code-block:: python

    def pytest_configure(config):
        # Ensure ORM classes are generated before tests run
        repository_root = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]
        generate_orm_path = (
            repository_root / "scripts" / "generate_orm.py"
        )
        # Execute the ORM generation script as a standalone module
        runpy.run_path(str(generate_orm_path), run_name="__main__")

    import domain_model.orm.ormatic_interface

Core Assumptions and Modeling Rules
-----------------------------------
To ensure unambiguous translation and an ergonomic generated ORM, ORMatic adheres to the following rules for dataclass modeling:

- **Protected Fields:** Any dataclass field name beginning with ``_`` is ignored for persistence. These protected fields are suitable for transient or derived runtime data.
- **Optional Types:** The only guaranteed supported union is :py:class:`Optional[T] <typing.Optional>`. Other unions are modeled using a shared superclass if there exists a common base that is not `object`.
- **Collections:** Iterables must be non-optional and non-nested. For an "optional list," use a default factory that returns an empty collection.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Inheritance is supported and generates `joined-table <https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/orm/inheritance.html>`_ inheritance. Note that only the *first* base class in a multiple inheritance structure is considered for queries using abstract classes.
- **Type Discipline:** Dataclass fields require concrete, non-ambiguous type annotations. Prefer small dataclasses or value objects over primitive types when modeling relationships.

When dataclasses cannot conform to these patterns, the following alternatives are available:

- **Alternative Mapping:** Explicit mapping classes can be provided to control how a dataclass is persisted.
- **Type Decorator:** Custom type decorators can be supplied for specialized value types.
Detailed information on these options is provided in the :ref:`alternative_mapping` section.

What ORMatic Generates
----------------------
Execution of ORMatic on a set of classes produces a module containing:

- ``Base``: An SQLAlchemy :py:class:`DeclarativeBase <sqlalchemy.orm.DeclarativeBase>` that manages metadata and a ``type_mappings`` registry for custom types.
- ``*DAO`` Classes: One class per dataclass (and per explicit mapping). Each is a SQLAlchemy declarative model that includes:
  - Columns for fields with built-in or custom types
  - Foreign keys and relationships inferred from nested dataclasses and collections
  - ``__mapper_args__`` for inheritance and polymorphic configuration

ORMatic analyzes the dataclass structure to identify scalar fields, one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many associations. This information is then used to generate a full, decoupled SQLAlchemy declarative layer via a Jinja template.


ORMatic Compatible Class Pattern
--------------------------------

If you want to generally know how to write classes that work out of the box with ORMatic, follow these simple rules:
 1. Everything is a dataclass
 2. Never write you own ``__init__``.
 3. Apply side effects (e. g. setting back references) in the ``__post_init__``
 4. Use protected fields, those whose name begins with ``_`` only for computational state that doesnt need persistence (e. g. caching, indexing, ...)
 5. Don't use nested containers as public fields
 6. Don't use dicts as public fields
 7. Never use optional containers, use empty containers by default.

Persisting Objects
------------------------
- :py:func:`krrood.ormatic.dao.to_dao`: Converts a dataclass instance into its corresponding DAO object, including recursive conversion of nested elements.
- :py:func:`krrood.ormatic.dao.DataAccessObject.from_dao`: Converts a loaded DAO instance back into the original dataclass, including nested components and collections.
