    Configuration for the QPController.
    .. warning:: Giskard relies on the robot tracking velocity commands well. Make sure it does!
    .. note::
    Tuning works the following way:
        1. Look at the frequency you get feedback from the robot and choose a frequency slightly below it.
            e.g. joint_states publishes at 100hz -> start with 90hz for the controller.
        2. Set prediction horizon to 7. This is often the fastest reasonable config.
        3. If the robot is NOT moving smoothly, increase prediction horizon until it does or giskard becomes unable to keep up with the frequency.
        4. If Giskard cannot keep up with the frequency, reduce hz and go back to step 2.

    Target frequency of the control loop in Hz.
    A higher value will result in a more responsive and thus smoother control signal, 
    but the QP will have to be solved more often per second.
    If the value is too low, the QP might start running into infeasiblity issues.

    .. note::
    On a real robot:
        Pick a value equal to or below the frequency at which we get feedback.
        Computing control commands at a higher frequency than the robot can provide feedback can result in instability.
        If you cannot match the frequency due to hardware limitations, pick one that is as close to it as possible.

    Increasing this value will:
        - make the commands produced by Giskard smoother
        - increase the computational cost of the controller.
    You'll want a value that is as high as necessary and as low as possible.
